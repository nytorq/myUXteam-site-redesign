        <h3 class="section-titles">Overview</h3>
          <p>Peppermill Reno is a hotel and casino located in Reno, NV. Sporting 10 restaurants and 15 bars & lounges, guest experience has always been paramount for their business. In 2014, we started discussions with Peppermill to entertain the idea of improving guest experience by building a mobile app. They wanted to build something better than just a digital brochure. They wanted something that their guests would truly value and make their stay even more enjoyable.</p>

        <h3 class="section-titles">Problem</h3>
          <p>Peppermill Reno is a hotel and casino located in Reno, NV. Sporting 10 restaurants and 15 bars & lounges, guest experience has always been paramount for their business. In 2014, we started discussions with Peppermill to entertain the idea of improving guest experience by building a mobile app. They wanted to build something better than just a digital brochure. They wanted something that their guests would truly value and make their stay even more enjoyable.</p>
        <h3 class="section-titles">Our Process</h3>
          <p>Our first aim was to identify any frustrations or headaches guests experienced at the Peppermill. That meant getting in front of their guests, so we spent an entire weekend at the resort to do just that. To further our research, we also interviewed Peppermill staff to uncover obstacles that prevented them from delivering the best service possible. After many discussions, we began to craft a guest journey, from check-in to check-out. In this research, we exposed a recurring ideal about the guest experience that had never fully been met. What was the ideal? Guests should truly "never lift a finger". With this renewed ideal in mind, we began crafting a conceptual mobile app that would make that ideal a reality.</p>
          <p>We started the design process with a bunch of low-fidelity designs that pinpointed areas we found in our research that could be improved. To make room service easier, we designed a workflow for ordering food right to your door. If you were interested in seeing an event at the Peppermill, you could order your tickets from the mobile app. Want to upgrade to VIP? It's only a couple taps away. With our wireframes, we worked with our stakeholder team to ensure that what we designed was within the overall vision.</p>

          />
          <p>During the process, we were asked to find out if there were ways to differentiate their mobile app from other major casino mobile apps. In response, we did a competitive analysis to figure out what set of features would give the Peppermill mobile app an edge.</p>

          </p>After several iterations and revisions, we coralled a core set of functionality perfect for a v1. myUXteam then finalized the designs by creating high-fidelity wireframes. While doing so, we began paving the road for a new digital style guide and pattern library for Peppermill.</p>
        <h3 class="section-titles">Conclusion</h3>
          <p>With a working prototype of our v1 mobile app, we then spent an entire morning presenting the mobile app, it's UX, the improvements in guest experience, and changes that would be required of the business. Lucky for us, the Peppermill top executives applauded our conceptual designs and direction.</p>
